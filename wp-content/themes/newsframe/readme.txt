I. Adding Your Own Logo
Use the theme options panel.
II. Customizing the template.
Please user a child theme for customizations. Alternatively, you can use a Custom CSS plugin.
III. Using the Full-Width Template
The full-width template lets you create a page (not a post) without a sidebar easily. To do so, select "Full Width" in the Page Attributes>Template section on the page editing screen.
IV. Using Featured Images and Subtitles on Posts
The default front page is configured to automatically display a post's featured image and subtitle below the article headline. The feature image will not be automatically added to the individual post page itself; you'll need to insert it into the content to display it on the full article page.
Subtitles are displayed on individual article pages and the home page (latest post). To add an article subtitle, use custom fields.
First, make sure you can view custom fields on the post editor (click on "Screen Options" and check "Custom Fields"), and then scroll below the post editor to the custom field box.
Enter "subtitle" (without quotes) in the first box. In the second box, type your subtitle tag.
V. Sticky Posts
Sticky posts will be displayed as "Featured Posts" just like the latest post. Use this option if you want to feature
a breaking story for a length of time, with your other posts appearing below it.
